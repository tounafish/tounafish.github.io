Michael is wonderfully creative, up to date with the latest styles and methods to create innovative layouts and designs. He is able to multitask, managing a team of designers, arranging photo shoots, attending planning meetings and various other duties, all while still creating magazine layouts and covers himself. He's hard working and dedicated to every project he takes on. I would highly recommend Michael for any and all creative positions. He can juggle several projects at once and always make deadline.

									<em>Editor-in-Chief, Reps magazine</em><p></p>
I had the pleasure of working with Michael Touna, or Tuna, for two-and-a-half years during his position as Group Creative Director at Robert Kennedy Publishing. During in his time overseeing the redesign of Reps magazine, Tuna was unfailingly brilliant in executing new creative concepts. Tuna worked under an extremely tight budget and intense workload and deadline pressures to completely revamp the magazine from front to back with a fresh, modern layout and design including a new original color palette. His exceptional leadership of the art team fostered an environment for top-notch layouts, from departments to features. Tuna has a knack for taking a good layouts and making them great. When it comes to creating layouts that pop, he’s an editor’s dream. On set, Tuna is always organized, focused and knows how to bring the vision for the shoots into reality. When we talked about a photo shoot concept beforehand, the final result almost always left me saying, “That’s exactly what we were looking for!” The models, photographers and illustrators all enjoyed working with Tuna, whose cheerful demeanor was always a welcome presence. Tuna is always keen to learn more, to dive into new projects and to take on challenges. He also takes the initiative to launch new processes that generate extra revenue and create efficiencies. For example, he created a dynamic online clipboard system to view previews of every issue of the magazine, which made things easier for everyone involved, from editorial to art to sales. In his time at RKP, Tuna was also universally liked and respected by his peers. I heard nothing but praise of him from those who worked for him, with him, and from upper management. From my perspective, I can’t recommend him highly enough.<br><em>August 17, 2013, Reps magazine</em><p></p><hr>

									<em>Chief Photographer at MagicLight Productions</em><p></p>
I have had the pleasure to work with Michael Touna for over a decade. I am a leading photographer in the Health & Fitness industry and as a result worked with Michael initially when he was in the Muscle & Fitness Magazine art department. During this time we worked together closely on countless photo shoots. The experience and outcome were always very positive. We subsequently worked together for two years while he was creative director for MuscleMag and Reps Magazines. My experiences with Michael are very positive on all levels. He is very hard working and creative. Tuna gets very involved with all phases of the shoot from conception to completion. There were many times when he even helped out with some of the prop styling. He had the ability to either fully come up with a concept or be open to ideas to improve the end result. His attention to detail in the planning phase helped make for a successful outcome. He is very easy to get along with, both for myself, the talent and all members of the team. I know he is willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done and put in the time. The end results always proved it He also stays calm under pressure, which sets a good tone for all.
I highly recommend Michael Touna for any Creative/Art Director position. I am confident he would be a strong asset for any company’s art team and a valuable member of the company.<br><em>June 10, 2013, Muscle & Fitness</em><p></p><hr>
