<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I make products and services better through the heuristics of UX. I'm a hands-on user experience designer, and I'm passionate about problem solving and creativity based on human computer interface development. Driven by working on complex problems, I love creating constructive and innovative user interface solutions. Check out <a href="http://www.mtouna.com">my portfolio</a> </p>
