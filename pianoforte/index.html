    <div id="about">
        <div><p>I am a classically trained pianist and piano instructor based in Old Greenwich, CT. I received my BFA in Piano Performace in 1982 from the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College, State University of New York. My first piano teacher was Joan Mathes of Old Greenwich, and I would go on to study with the renowned Sascha Gorodnitzki in New York City (1975-79), as well as Daniel Epstein, also of New York (1979-82). I began teaching my own students at the young age of 15, continuing throughout my high school and university years and for many years thereafter. Even when not teaching full-time more recently, I was active as a substitute keyboardist at Saint Saviour's Church in Old Greenwich; substitute keyboardist, accompanist, and frequent performer at Stanwich Congregational Church in Greenwich; and accompanist for bassoon and vocal students in recitals and recordings.</p>

        <p>I take pride in my ability to work with a wide range of students in the classical tradition, using a structured approach that also incorporates flexibiltiy tailored to each pupil's indivicual learning style and goals. I takes both technique and musicality seriously, and expects the same from my students. I believes that solid technique and understanding of musical theory provide the toolkit for unlocking all that music has to offer. Christine knows that classical piano training provides the best foundation for any musical goals students may wish to pursue.</p>
